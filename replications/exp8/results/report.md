Our evaluations and controls (controls are ours):

| Stage | Model | Benchmark | Author comparator | Accuracy | Standard error | Samples | Hit token limit | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| calibration_base | Qwen/Qwen3.5-0.8B | math500 | unedited: [7.9%](../reference/unedited.json) | [7.2%](calibration_base/summary.json) | [1.16%](calibration_base/summary.json) | [500](calibration_base/summary.json) | [93.2%](calibration_base/summary.json) | [done](calibration_base/summary.json) |

Only recorded values are shown. Missing fields remain pending; partial runs retain their recorded status.

Calibration comparison: pending.

Recorded runtime and uncertainty:

| Stage / benchmark | Engine | GPU | Transformers | Uncertainty method |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| calibration_base / math500 | [vllm==0.33.0](calibration_base/summary.json) | [H100](calibration_base/summary.json) | [5.17.0](calibration_base/summary.json) | pending |

| Stage | Benchmark | Recorded hours | Recorded cost (USD) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| calibration_base | math500 | [0.465](calibration_base/summary.json) | [2.1280](calibration_base/summary.json) |

Costs and durations come from the linked records. Missing costs are not treated as zero; rows are not summed because stages may overlap.
